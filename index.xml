      <description>These ribs are to die for. I mean, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a good rack of ribs. They have the right amount of smoke, and if you are like me, you want them to have a good kick to them. And amazingly, these are low carb Keto Friendly.
First, I apply a dry rub and let it sit overnight to absorb all of that flavor. When ready to cook, I use the 3-2-1 method.</description>
